### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Take a module feature

#### Implementation

The `take` command is implemented via the `TakeCommand` and `TakeCommandParser` classes.

The `TakeCommandParser` class implements the `Parser` interface and is responsible for parsing the user input to retrieve the index and `AcademicYear` object which represents the year and semester. <br>
The `TakeCommandParser#parse()` method does this, and returns a `TakeCommand` object with the index and the `AcademicYear` object as arguments.

The `TakeCommand` class extends the `Command` class and implements the `TakeCommand#execute()` method which handles the main logic of the class. <br>
It contains non-null `index` and `academicCalendar` fields. <br>
When the `TakeCommand#execute()` method is called,

- The `Module` object corresponding to the `index` is found from the `Model`.
- A copy of the `Module` object is made with the value of `academicCalendar`, which is stored in its corresponding field in the copy.
- The `Module` object in the Model is then replaced by this copy.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**

- When a new `Module` object is added to the module tracker, its `academicCalendar` field is unassigned by default.
- Removing a schedule from a module is not supported in the `take` command, this functionality is instead moved to a separate `untake` command.
- If the module is already scheduled, its current `academicCalendar` field will be overridden by a new `AcademicCalendar` object.
</div>

Below is a sequence diagram, and an explanation of how `TakeCommand` is executed.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `take 2 y/1 s/2` Command](images/TakeSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `TakeCommand` and `TakeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

**Step 1.** The user enters the command "take 2 y/1 s/2".

**Step 2.** ModuleTrackerParser takes in the user's input, and calls `TakeCommandParser#parse` to create a TakeCommand object containing the data parsed from the user input.
* In this case, the TakeCommand object contains the specified module index (`2`), and the academic year the specified module is scheduled for (`y/1 s/2`)

**Step 3.** The `TakeCommand` is then executed by calling its `execute` method.

**Step 4.** The module at the specified index (`2`) in the list is obtained from the `Model`.

**Step 5.** A copy of this module containing the specified academic calendar (`y/1 s/2`) is created. This copy is the scheduled module.

**Step 6.** The specified module in the `Model` is then replaced by the scheduled copy. The `Model` is also updated to reflect this change in the Mod Tracker.

Certain details have been omitted from the sequence diagram for simplicity, including:
* Details of how the specified module (`moduleToSchedule`) is obtained from the `Model`.
* Details of how the `Model` is updated to reflect the changes in the Mod Tracker.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the user can take a module**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User uses a separate command (`take`) to take a module
    - Pros:
        - Allows some flexibility for the user if he has not decided when to take the module.
    - Cons:
        - More steps involved for the user to take a module.
- **Alternative 2:** User indicates the year and semester when adding the module to the tracker.
    - Pros:
        - Easier for the user to take a module as there are less steps involved.
    - Cons:
        - The `add` command will contain many arguments, which might make it difficult for users to remember.

**Aspect: Format of user input**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users use `y/`, `s/` prefixes to specify year and semester.
    - Pros:
        - Easier to parse user inputs to get the needed data.
    - Cons:
        - Less flexible for the user.
- **Alternative 2:** Users are allowed to specify the year and semester using string inputs (i.e. y1s2, year 1 semester 2)
    - Pros:
        - Greater flexibility for the user.
    - Cons:
        - More difficult to parse the user input to extract the needed data.
        - Is inconsistent with the format of other commands.

### Find modules feature

#### Implementation

The `find` command is implemented via the `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` classes.

The `FindCommandParser` class implements the `Parser` interface and the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method is responsible for parsing the user input to retrieve the `args` String which represents the keywords to search the modules by. <br>
When the `FindCommandParser#parse()` method is called,

- The `args` String is converted into two arrays of String(s) called `nameKeywords` and `optionalFilter`.
- The `nameKeywords` array consists of the keywords to search the modules with and the `optionalFilter` array consists of specific components of the module to search for the keywords.
- A new `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is created by passing in the arrays `nameKeywords` and `optionalFilter` as arguments.
- A `FindCommand` object is returned with the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as its argument.

The `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class implements the `Predicate` interface and the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` method is responsible for checking if the given module contains any of the valid keywords. <br>
It contains the non-null `keywords` and `optionalFilter` fields, which is used to find the appropriate modules in the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` method. <br>
When the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` method is called, it takes in a `Module` and returns a boolean depending on whether the keyword is found inside the `module`.


The `FindCommand` class extends the `Command` class and implements the `FindCommand#execute()` method which handles the main logic of the class. <br>
It contains the non-null `predicate` field. <br>
When the `FindCommand#execute()` method is called,

- The `Model` object is updated with a new `predicate`.
- The `Model` filters the module list based on the given `predicate`.
- A `CommandResult` is returned with the updated `Model`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the user can find a module**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User uses a separate command (`find`) to take a module, along with additional optional parameters as filters.
    - Pros:
        - Gives the user more control when finding a specific module.
        - Allows the user to view a more curated/specific set of results.
    - Cons:
        - User might want to view a general set of modules.
        - Might be troublesome for the user to memorise all the optional parameters.
- **Alternative 2:** User uses a separate command (`find`) to take a module, without the use of additional optional parameters.
    - Pros:
        - Easier for the user to use as there is no need to memorise all the optional parameters.
    - Cons:
        - More error prone (such as users typing `find c` and the application returns all the modules, which has the same effect as using the list command.

**Aspect: Format of user input**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users use `c/`, `t/` prefixes to specify which components of the module to search in.
    - Pros:
        - Easier to parse user inputs to get the needed data.
    - Cons:
        - Less flexible for the user.
        - Might be troublesome for the user to memorise all the optional parameters.
- **Alternative 2:** Users are allowed to use generic prefixes to specify which components of the module to search in.
    - Pros:
        - Greater flexibility for the user and more intuitive for the user.
    - Cons:
        - Difficult for the application to differentiate between keywords and words for specifying a certain component.
        - Might be error prone (such as when the user wants to search the entire module with the keyword `title` but the program interprets it as searching inside the module title).
        - Is inconsistent with the format of other commands.
- **Alternative 3:** Users specify what value to search for in each prefix ie `y/3`, `s/2`.
    - Pros:
        - Allows search result to be more specific.
    - Cons:
        - Might be tedious for user to manually specify each field to search for.
        - Requires the user to know what to search for, which might be hard for users who do not have the specific details of the module.

### Clear modules feature

####Implementation

The `clear` command is implemented via the `ClearCommand`, `ClearCommandParser` and `ModuleInSpecificSemesterPredicate` classes.

The `ClearCommandParser` class implements the `Parser` interface.
The `ClearCommandParser#parse()` method is responsible for parsing the user input to retrieve the `AcademicYear` and `Semester` object which specify the semester that the user want to untake all modules in it. The method will return a `ClearCommand` object with `AcadenicCalendar` as its argument.
The `ClearCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` method is responsible to check if all fields stated in the arguments are provided.

The `ClearCommand` class extends the `Command` class and implements the `ClearCommand#execute()` method which handles the main logic of the class.
When the `ClearCommand#execute()` method is called,
- All `Module` objects which has the corresponding `AcademicCalendar` is filtered out from the `Model` and store in a list
- For each `Module` in the list, the `Module` is replaced by a copy of it without `AcademicCalander` field.
- A `CommandResult` is returned with the updated `Model`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How should clear command work**

- **Alternative 1(current choice)**: When a clear command is called, all modules in a specific semester will be untaked.
    - Pros:
      - Allow users to untake multiple modules conveniently.
      - User can replan the specific semester using clear command.
    - Cons:
      - The command name might be confusing
- **Alternative 2:** When a clear command is called, all modules in a specific semester will be deleted.
    - Pros:
      - Allow users to delete multiple modules conveniently.
      - User can replan the specific semester using clear command.
    - Cons:
      - User need to add all the modules again, if they want to use it later
- **Alternative 3:** When a clear command is called, all modules in the module tracker list will be deleted.
    - Pros:
      - Allow users to delete everything and restart conveniently
    - Cons:
      - All modules stored in the storage in advance will be deleted as well
      - User need to add all the modules again, once the clear command is called
      - It will be expensive, if the user accidentally use clear command
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
