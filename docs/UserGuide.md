## Introduction
![NUS Mod Tracker Icon](images/nus_mod_tracker.png)

NUS Mod Tracker is a **desktop app** for **NUS Computer Science (CS) students** to **manage their modules and track their course completion.**
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI).

### Main Features 

Here is an overview of the main features that NUS Mod Tracker provides:
* Keep track of your Modular Credits(MC).
* Keep track of the modules that you have taken.  
* Create your own academic plan.

For more information about our features, you can head over to our [Features](#features) section. Better yet, 
head over to our [Quick Start](#quick-start) and try it out for yourself!

### How to use the user guide 

We strongly recommend first time users of our application to read through the user guide in the order that it is written. Throughout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `modtracker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Mod Tracker.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all modules.

   * **`add c/CS2103T t/Software Engineering d/Covers the main areas of software development n/4 tag/core`** : Adds a module named `CS2103T` to the Mod Tracker.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd module shown in the current list.


Kindly refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add m/MODULE`, `MODULE` is a parameter which can be used as `add m/GEQ1000`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `c/CODE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `c/CS2103T tag/core` or as `c/CS2103T`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/GEQ1000 m/GEQ1000`, only `m/GEQ1000` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

![Mcs Display](images/mcsDisplay.png)

The user's progress is displayed in the form of:
* The number of Mcs completed for that category, over the number of required Mcs.
* A progress bar filled according to the level of completion.

**Total Mcs completed display:**

![total Mcs Display](images/totalMcsCompletedDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of Mcs taken, over the user's set Mc goal.
* The total number of Mcs taken is calculated from all modules taken before the current semester.
  * For example: If the current semester is year 1 semester 2, the total number of Mcs will be calculated
  from all modules taken in year 1 semester 1 only.

**Course requirements display:**

![requirements Mcs Display](images/courseRequirementsDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of Mcs taken for that requirement, over the number of Mcs needed to satisfy the requirement.

  * For example: Mcs for modules taken which are tagged with "ge" (`tag/ge`) will be counted into the total number of MCs taken for the GE requirement.
* Modules with the following tags will be used in calculating the Mcs completed for the corresponding requirement:

Requirement | Tag (not case sensitive)
------------|-----------
GE | "ge"
UE | "ue"
Foundation | "foundation"
Breadth and Depth | "breadth and depth"
IT Professionalism | "it professionalism"
Math and Science | "math and science"
